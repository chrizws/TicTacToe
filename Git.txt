Git - open source and free source control management (SCM)
Manage changes to files over time, view previous changes, compare different versions, track changes

setup user name
$ git config --global user.name "First Last"

setup email address
$ git config --global user.email "test@gmail.com"

initialize repository
$ cd c:\folder\repository
$ git init

status of repository
$ git status

if any files are untracked then Git won't keep track of any changes to that file

to stage or track a file, staging prepares the file to be committed
$ git add filename.txt (case sensitive and include file extension)

to track all the files in a folder to the staging area
$ git add .
$ git add A
$ git add --All

to unstage or untrack a file
$ git rm --cached filename.txt

to ignore files and prevent tracking
create .gitignore file or use powershell "ren gitignore.txt .gitignore" to rename gitignore.txt to .gitignore file
add file name or *.ext to ignore all ext type files
git will ignore all associated files

	
Commit takes a snapshot of files at this moment in time
$ git commit -m "insert commit message here"

to display changes in the committed file vs what's changed in the uncomitted file
$ git diff

to delete file from commit and system folder permanently
$ git rm filename

three types of git environments
	working tree to make changes and edits
		to commit directly without going to staging 
		$ git commit -a -m "commit directly and skips staging"
		
	staging / index tracks the files to be committed 
		remove from staging back to working files environments
		$ git restore --staged filename
		
	commit takes the changes made into the log
